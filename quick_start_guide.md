# Business Startup Suite - Quick Start Guide

## Welcome!
The Business Startup Suite helps you start your business with simple, step-by-step guidance. This quick start guide will get you up and running in minutes.

## Step 1: Access the Dashboard
Open the Business Startup Suite in your web browser. You'll see the main dashboard with four application cards:
- LLC Formation
- EIN Application
- Business Bank Account
- Licenses & Permits

## Step 2: Follow the Recommended Order
For most users, we recommend completing the applications in this order:

1. **Form Your LLC** - Create your business entity
2. **Get Your EIN** - Obtain your tax ID number
3. **Open a Bank Account** - Set up your business finances
4. **Secure Licenses & Permits** - Ensure legal compliance

However, you can start with any application based on your current needs.

## Step 3: Track Your Progress
The dashboard shows your progress for each application. As you complete steps, the progress bars will update automatically.

## Step 4: Save Your Work
Your progress is saved automatically. You can leave and return at any time to continue where you left off.

## Step 5: Get Your Documents
Each application generates the documents you need. You can download, print, or email these documents directly from the suite.

## Tips for Success
- Have your personal identification documents ready
- Set aside 15-30 minutes for each application
- Complete one application before moving to the next
- Use the help icons (?) for additional guidance on specific questions
